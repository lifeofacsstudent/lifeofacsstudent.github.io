Job appliction stories #2 

I think the web is very useful. I did not say anything new, but it is true. I was only sitting in my bedroom and I was checking out some job offers. From the comfort of my home I could find a job fitting my skills. They wanted to hire a student to work as a junior Java developer. I was happy, so I sent my CV and soon they called me (In fact I was taking part on the Java course on that day). 
They were happy that I applied, they liked my CV so we made an interview appointment! :) It was my first job interview and I had no experience at all, but I was to the moon and back!
