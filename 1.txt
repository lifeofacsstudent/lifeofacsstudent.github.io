Short introduction

Hi there, dear Reader!
Thanks for exploring my site! 
First I would like to give a short introduction about myself, because I think it is best way to start a blog! :) Maybe you have some questions, so I will try to answer a few! ;)
Who are you?
I'm Leah, a 19 year-old Hungarian girl. I live in small village and at the moment I am between secondary school (because I finished it in May) and university (they haven't picked me up yet, I would like to start in September). This is the main reason I am starting this blog now. 
Here is a to-do and a to-dream list:
 > I will learn Computer Science. 
 > I will have a degree. 
 > I will work as a developer. 
 > I will have my own company. 
Later on, if you will read my posts, I will talk about these in details, so you will understand why these are on my list. 
What will this blog be about? 
Good question. I do not consider myself a girlish girl, I do not mean that I'm a boy, I only mean that I like things that are not especially considered to be girlish (yet). I want to talk about my world (and maybe yours, too, 'couse you are reading this): technology, computer science, programming languages, etc. I think you got it. :) I'm also interested in some specific topics like AI(mainly NLP), esoteric programming languages (my favourite is BF) and an interesting one, which is not connecting to anything I mentioned before: Philosophy.

When do you start this blog?
Best question! I almost forgot it! This is my very first and most important thing to do now: 
By the authority invested in me, I start this blog now.
